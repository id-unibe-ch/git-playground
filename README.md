# git-playground

This repo and its content has only one purpose: **to learn, to test and to
train git**. It does so by featuring pre-built branches with example content
laid out in a way that use cases can be played through before applying them to
the "real life" problems.

Additional content is very welcome. Just fork, crate two new branches:

* One branch that extends this README with the new use case. This is then merge
  via a PR
* Another branch for the example data to work on if needed. This won't get merged
  but protected.

## Use Cases

More use cases and recipes can be found [here](https://michael.rollis.ch/myitjournal/gitandco/gitrecipes/#damn-i-branched-off-wrong-parent-branch).
